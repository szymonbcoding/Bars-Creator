Now this script can create csv file, which contains Movie_Year text, Distribution text and also flags for visibility of specific types of bars in Photoshop file.

It is possibilities to improve effectiveness or inserting titles. For that moment you can copy last distribution name or delete last title in case of e.g. misspell.
 Map with the most common distributors is added. You can now use it, but still you do not have instruction about using it in console.
 
In future, I would like to add SimpleGUI.
